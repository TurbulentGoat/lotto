<h1>üé≤ Lottery Number Generator üé≤</h1>

## Disclaimer
Firstly, this does NOT improve your odds of winning.

Any "predictions" made are not actual predictions; the code is simply checking what the most frequent numbers picked are and puts them in lines.


<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT GAMBLE IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THAT MONEY!!</h2>


## Lottery Results

To update the results, go to the [Lotterywest Results Page](https://www.lotterywest.wa.gov.au/results/frequency-charts) and download whichever CSV you want to update. **Do NOT change the name of the CSV** or the code will not find it. Make sure the new CSV overwrites the old one and keep it in the same location as `lotto.py`.
